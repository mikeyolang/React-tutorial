###Mikey on a Good React Developer
  -Decide on componets
  -Decide oon states and where it live- app architecture
  -What changes whould be made when state changes

###Creating a new React app 
  -npx create-react-app <app -name>
      -npm: quicky create 
     -npm install -g create-react-app(before the npx)
  -use an online platformF
###Fun with the Command line
-npm i -g cowsay -> cowsay Hello
you can uninstall it by npm uninstall -g cowsay
-You can use thee npx
```
index.js is the entry point
    react-DOM is related to the web. Builds web applications
    strict-mode
    app is the entire react app
     ReactDom.render
```
-class can be used instead of functions
-When class is used its state.
-We use JSX attributes in the index.js eg ```ClassName```
The ```{...}``` whatever is inside the brackest are variables
-With JSX we can create a virtualDOM.
```super()``` helps in calling the react.Component
